# BetterMob

A Paper plugin for registering custom mobs in YAML — MysticMobs/MythicMobs-style —
and rendering them through [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) or
[ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/). Includes a
small skill engine for AI behavior, triggers, and MythicMobs-compatible skill syntax.

## Requirements

- Paper (or a fork) **1.21+** — [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) is supported too
- Java 21
- [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) and/or
  [ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/) installed
  and enabled if you want mobs to actually render a custom model — without either,
  mobs still spawn and run their AI/skills, just with their vanilla appearance. A mob
  can use either engine (or both, for different mobs), chosen per `Skills:` line via
  `model{}` (BetterModel) or `modelengine{}` (ModelEngine).

## Model engine support

A mob's model comes from [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) or
[ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/). Both are optional and
independent: each uses its own model IDs, and a model must exist in the engine you point at it.

| Feature | BetterModel | ModelEngine |
|---|---|---|
| Attach a model with `model{mid=...}` | Yes | - |
| Attach a model with `modelengine{mid=...}` | - | Yes |
| `Model:` field in the mob file (automatic attach on spawn, load and reload) | Yes | Yes, used when BetterModel has no model with that id |
| Hide the vanilla body while a model is attached | Yes | Yes |
| Model reattached after restart/chunk load | Yes | Yes (through `Model:` or a `modelengine{}` line on `~onLoad`) |
| `state{s=...}` plays a model animation | Yes (once) | Yes (`lerpIn`, `lerpOut`, `speed`, `force`) |
| `mountmodel{seat=...}` (rideable seats) | Yes | Yes (`controller=walking\|flying\|walking_force\|flying_force`) |
| `@ModelPart{p=<bone>}` targeter (bone position) | Yes | Yes |
| `bodyrotation{...}` head/body turn limits | Yes | Yes |

Both engines are reached through reflection, so BetterMob has no compile dependency on either; the ModelEngine
calls are checked against ModelEngine R4.0.9 and R4.1.0. If a model id exists in both engines the `Model:` field
uses BetterModel. Using both engines for different mobs on one server works.

## Building

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Produces `target/bettermob-<version>.jar`. Drop it into your server's `plugins/`
folder.

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

JUnit 5 tests cover the line parsers (skill steps, conditions, mob triggers, drop lines, inline
skills). `PackFilesTest` also parses every line of the YAML files shipped in `src/main/resources`
and of any pack placed under `src/test/resources/packs/` - use the usual `Mobs/`, `Items/`,
`Skills/` and `DropTables/` folder names. The workflow runs `mvn test` on every push and pull
request, and a failing test stops the build and the release.

The Java code is kept free of comments. The `Strip code comments` workflow runs
`.github/scripts/strip_comments.py` on the Java files a pull request changes and commits
`Remove code comments` to the branch (pull requests from forks need the `PR_PUSH_TOKEN` secret and
maintainer edits enabled; without them the check fails with the list of files).

## Wiki

The wiki pages are in [`wiki/`](wiki). Edit them in a pull request, a workflow publishes them to the
[GitHub wiki](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki) once the change is on `dev`. Do not edit the wiki on GitHub directly.

## Pack compatibility

Which MythicMobs packs were tried and how far they run is on the wiki page
[Pack compatibility](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki/Pack-Compatibility); check your own pack with `/bettermob validate <pack>`.

## Editor support

JSON schemas for mob, skill and item files live in [`schemas/`](schemas). They give auto-completion and error hints for the known fields, the entity types, the boss bar colours and styles, and the trigger suffix of `Skills:` lines; unknown fields stay allowed because BetterMob ignores them. A mob file may hold one mob (with `Type:` at the root) or several mobs, both are covered.

**VS Code** (with the Red Hat "YAML" extension), in `settings.json`:

```json
"yaml.schemas": {
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/main/schemas/mob.schema.json": ["**/BetterMob/mobs/**/*.yml", "**/BetterMob/packs/*/[mM]obs/**/*.yml"],
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/main/schemas/skill.schema.json": ["**/BetterMob/skills/**/*.yml", "**/BetterMob/packs/*/[sS]kills/**/*.yml"],
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/main/schemas/item.schema.json": ["**/BetterMob/items/**/*.yml", "**/BetterMob/packs/*/[iI]tems/**/*.yml"]
}
```

**IntelliJ IDEA**: Settings, Languages & Frameworks, Schemas and DTDs, JSON Schema Mappings. Add each schema (URL above or the downloaded file), choose "JSON Schema version 7" and map the file patterns or folders.

The schemas do not check the content of the skill lines (mechanic, condition and targeter names); use `/bettermob validate` for that. A test checks that every mob, skill and item file shipped with the plugin and the sample packs matches the schemas.

## Code layout

Everything lives under `eu.northsoft.bettermob`: `api`/`api.event` (public API), `command`, `mob`,
`skill` (engine and parser) with `skill.mechanic`, `skill.condition` and `skill.target` (one class per
mechanic, condition and targeter behind the `Mechanic`, `SkillCondition` and `Targeter` interfaces),
`ai`, `model`, `drop`, `item`, `pack`, `lang`, `debug`, `integration` (PlaceholderAPI), `service` and `util`.
To add a mechanic, implement `Mechanic` and register it in `BuiltinMechanics.registerAll`; see the
[Development](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki/Development) wiki page.

## Releases

Every push to `main` and every PR triggers a GitHub Actions build (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
that compiles the jar and uploads it as a build artifact. A release is cut automatically
when the version in `pom.xml` changes (see "Getting the API").

### Dev builds

Pushing to the `dev` branch builds the jar and publishes it as the **Dev build**
pre-release (tag `dev-build`). There is only ever one: each push replaces it with the newest jar
(`bettermob-<version>-dev-<commit>.jar`). It is unstable and meant for testing, the
tagged releases above are the stable ones.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/bettermob spawn <id> [amount]` | Spawn a registered mob at your location |
| `/bettermob list` | List all registered mob IDs |
| `/bettermob packs` | List discovered packs and whether they're enabled |
| `/bettermob info <mob>` | Show a mob's type, health, damage, faction, model, equipment, number of drop entries, skills by trigger and how many are alive |
| `/bettermob top [mob]` | The 10 players with the most kills, of all BetterMob mobs or of one mob (permission `bettermob.top`) |
| `/bettermob reload` | Reload config, mobs, skills, and packs |
| `/bettermob validate [pack]` | Check a pack (or all of them) for unsupported mechanics, conditions, targeters, undefined skills, model ids that exist in neither BetterModel nor ModelEngine, and unparsable lines (including drop lines) without spawning anything |
| `/bettermob skill <id> [player]` | Manually run a registered skill, bypassing its normal triggers |
| `/bettermob give <item> [player] [amount]` | Give a registered item (see [Items](#items)) |
| `/bettermob egg <mob> [player] [amount]` | Give a spawn egg that spawns exactly that mob (see Spawn eggs below) |
| `/bettermob killall [mob\|*] [world]` | Remove all living BetterMob mobs, or only one type and/or one world, and report how many |
| `/bettermob spawner create <id> <mob> [radius] [interval] [max]` | Create a spawner at your position; `remove <id>` and `list` manage them |
| `/bettermob stats [on\|off\|reset]` | Show living mobs per type, running timers, loaded skills and packs; `on`/`off` switch the skill timing, `reset` clears it (permission `bettermob.debug`) |
| `/bettermob debug [off\|info\|verbose\|filter <id>\|filter clear\|chat]` | Show or change the debug output (permission `bettermob.debug`, part of `bettermob.admin`) |

Alias: `/bmob`.

| Permission | Allows | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `bettermob.admin` | everything below | op |
| `bettermob.spawn` | `/bettermob spawn` | op |
| `bettermob.list` | `/bettermob list`, `/bettermob packs` and `/bettermob info` | op |
| `bettermob.reload` | `/bettermob reload` and `/bettermob validate` | op |
| `bettermob.skill` | `/bettermob skill` | op |
| `bettermob.give` | `/bettermob give` and `/bettermob egg` | op |
| `bettermob.killall` | `/bettermob killall` | op |
| `bettermob.spawner` | `/bettermob spawner` | op |
| `bettermob.top` | `/bettermob top` | op |
| `bettermob.debug` | `/bettermob debug` | op |

`bettermob.admin` is the parent of all the others. Without a node the subcommand is refused, left out of the help and left out of tab completion. `bettermob.faction.<name>` (see `factions` in `config.yml`) is unrelated to the commands.

**Reload:** `/bettermob reload` also updates mobs that are already alive. Each one is bound to the new definition of the same id: name, health cap, attack, speed and the options are applied again, its timers are restarted (the old ones are cancelled, so nothing runs twice), its auras and global cooldown are cleared, the model is attached again and the `~onLoad` skills run again. AI goals are applied again only when `AIGoalSelectors` or `AITargetSelectors` changed and the new list starts with `clear`; goals an earlier `clear` removed cannot come back until the mob is respawned. A mob whose definition was removed keeps the old one and a warning is logged. Totem bodies that are already in the world run out on their own.

**Kill counters:** every kill of a BetterMob mob by a player is counted per player and mob id and saved in `plugins/BetterMob/kills.yml` (written every five minutes and when the server stops, without blocking the server). `/bettermob top` lists the best players, and PlaceholderAPI exposes the numbers (see the placeholders table). Only kills by players count; mobs that die from other causes are not counted.

**Killall:** `/bettermob killall` removes every loaded living BetterMob mob; `<mob>` limits it to one id (`*` means all) and `<world>` to one world. Mobs in unloaded chunks are not touched. Without a mob id it also removes helper armor stands (the hit bodies of `totem` skills). Those carry the scoreboard tag `bettermob_helper`, and only entities with that tag are ever removed. Leftover helpers are also removed on startup and whenever a chunk loads.

**Spawners:** `/bettermob spawner create camp goblin 6 20 4` makes a spawner at your position that spawns `goblin` at a random ground spot within 6 blocks every 20 seconds (defaults: radius 5, 30 s, max 3) while a player is within 32 blocks, and never lets more than 4 of its loaded mobs live at once. They are stored in `plugins/BetterMob/spawners.yml` (`mob`, `world`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `radius`, `interval`, `max`, `player-range`) and reloaded with `/bettermob reload`. Spawned mobs carry the scoreboard tag `bettermob_spawner:<id>`, which is how its mobs are counted again after a restart or when their chunk loads.

**Stats:** `/bettermob stats` shows the living BetterMob mobs per type, the running mob timers and the loaded skills and packs. With `Stats: on` in `config.yml` (or `/bettermob stats on`) it also measures every skill run and lists the 10 skills with the most total time (calls, average, maximum), plus the delayed steps that are still waiting. A run is measured up to its first `delay` and includes the skills it starts in the same tick. `StatsWarnMillis` (default 50, 0 turns it off) logs a console warning when a single run takes longer. While stats are off nothing is measured or counted. Delayed steps whose mob disappears before they run are not subtracted, so `reset` now and then. Uses the permission `bettermob.debug`.

**Debug:** set `Debug: off|info|verbose` in `config.yml`, or change it at runtime with `/bettermob debug`.
`info` logs every trigger that fires (and whether the event was cancelled), every skill run with the reason it
stopped (conditions, target conditions, cooldown, `castinstead`) and AI goals that are missing (with the goals
the mob type has). `verbose` adds every mechanic with its targeter, target count and parameters, `cancelskill`,
bone offsets, `shoot` and `totem`. `filter <id>` limits the output to one mob id, skill id or player name,
`chat` also sends it to you in chat. Nothing is built or logged while debug is off.

## Languages

Console and command messages live in `plugins/BetterMob/lang/<code>.yml`. `en` and `de` are written
there on first start. Pick one with `Language:` in `config.yml` (default `en`) and apply it with
`/bettermob reload`.

To add a language, copy `lang/en.yml` to `lang/<code>.yml`, translate the values and set
`Language: <code>`. Keys you leave out fall back to the bundled English text. Values use `&` colour codes
and placeholders such as `{mob}`, `{skill}`, `{folder}` or `{error}`, keep the placeholders of the English
original. Debug output (`/bettermob debug`) stays English.

## Folder layout

```
plugins/BetterMob/
├── config.yml          # DisabledPacks: [...]
├── lang/                 # message files (en.yml, de.yml, your own)
│   └── en.yml
├── mobs/                # default mob files
│   └── my_mob.yml
├── skills/               # default skill files
│   └── my_skill.yml
├── items/                # default item files

        ├── mobs/
        ├── skills/
        ├── items/
        └── droptables/
```

The flat `mobs/`/`skills/` folders are always loaded. Each subfolder under `packs/`
is its own bundle with its own `mobs/`/`skills/` (case-insensitive — `Mobs`/`Skills`
work too, matching how most MythicMobs packs are shipped). Disable a pack by adding
its folder name to `DisabledPacks` in `config.yml`.

If two mobs or skills share an ID, the one loaded first wins; the rest are skipped
with a console warning.

## Defining a mob

A mob file can define **one mob** (fields directly at the file root, ID = filename)
or **multiple mobs** (each top-level key is its own mob, like a classic MysticMobs
`mobs.yml`):

```yaml
# mobs/skeleton_knight.yml — one mob, ID = "skeleton_knight"
Type: SKELETON
Display: '&c&lSkeleton Knight'
Model: skeleton_knight      # BetterModel model ID; defaults to the mob ID
Health: 60
Damage: 8
RemoveAi: false
Faction: Elite              # mobs of one faction never target or hurt each other
Equipment:                  # item or material : slot (HAND, OFFHAND, HEAD, CHEST, LEGS, FEET)
  - BOW:HAND
  - my_helmet:HEAD
Spawn:                      # replaces natural spawns of the mob's Type (here SKELETON) that match
  Worlds: [world]           # optional, empty = every world
  Biomes: [desert, plains]  # optional, empty = every biome
  Time: night               # day | night | any (default)
  Chance: 0.3               # 0-1, rolled per natural spawn, default 1

AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - randomstroll            # matched against the mob's actual vanilla goals
AITargetSelectors:
  - clear

Options:
  Collidable: true
  MovementSpeed: 0.25
  PreventOtherDrops: true
  Silent: true
  PreventRenaming: false
  PreventLeashing: false
  AlwaysShowName: false
  PreventSunburn: true       # zombies/skeletons won't burn in daylight
  Invincible: false
  # Armor-stand style mobs (e.g. floating, hands-off display cards):
  Invisible: false           # hide the body, equipment stays visible
  CanMove: true              # false = no AI and no gravity (floats in place)
  Interactable: true         # false = right clicks / equipment swaps are cancelled
  Marker: false              # armor stands only: no hitbox
  ItemHead: my_item          # a registered item (see Items) worn on the head
  KnockbackResistance: 1
  FollowRange: 15
  Scale: 0.5
  PreventItemPickup: true

Modules:
  ThreatTable: true           # retarget to whoever dealt the most damage
  BossBar:                    # health bar for players nearby
    Title: '&c<mob.name> &7<mob.hp>/<mob.maxhp>'
    Range: 64
    Color: RED
    Style: SOLID

DamageModifiers:
  - FIRE 1.2                  # multiply fire damage taken by 1.2

Skills:
  - skill{s=my_skill_id} ~onInteract
  - sound{s=entity.skeleton.ambient;p=1.0;v=1} @self ~onTimer:200
```

**Spawn rules:** a `Spawn` block turns the mob into a natural spawn. Whenever the server spawns a vanilla mob of the same `Type` naturally (not from spawners, eggs or commands) and the world, biome, time of day and `Chance` all fit, that spawn is replaced by this mob. `Worlds` and `Biomes` take lists (biome ids with or without `minecraft:`), `Time` is `day`, `night` or `any`. Without a `Spawn` block nothing is replaced; if several mobs match, the first one that passes its chance wins. A `Worlds` or `Biomes` that is not a list, a `Chance` that is not a number or an unknown `Time` logs a warning and the whole `Spawn` block is ignored, so a typo never widens the spawn.

`Modules: BossBar:` shows a boss bar with the mob's health to every player within `Range` blocks (same world). `BossBar: true` uses the defaults.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Title` | `<mob.name>` | Text of the bar; `&` colour codes, `<mob.name>` (the `Display`), `<mob.id>`, `<mob.hp>` and `<mob.maxhp>` (rounded up) and PlaceholderAPI placeholders without a player |
| `Range` | `64` | Blocks around the mob in which players see the bar |
| `Color` | `RED` | `PINK`, `BLUE`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `PURPLE` or `WHITE` |
| `Style` | `SOLID` | `SOLID`, `SEGMENTED_6`, `SEGMENTED_10`, `SEGMENTED_12` or `SEGMENTED_20` |
| `CreateFog` / `DarkenSky` / `PlayMusic` | `false` | Boss bar effects of the client |

The bar updates twice a second and is removed when the mob dies, despawns, its chunk unloads, on `/bettermob reload` (it is rebuilt from the new definition) and when the plugin is disabled. An unknown `Color` or `Style` logs a warning and uses the default.

A file with multiple mobs looks like:

```yaml
nm_mustang_red:
  Type: IRON_GOLEM
  ...
nm_mustang_cyan:
  Type: IRON_GOLEM
  ...
```

`AIGoalSelectors`/`AITargetSelectors` only work with goals the mob's vanilla AI
actually has — Paper can reuse existing goals, not invent new ones. `clear` removes
the category first; named goals (matched loosely, e.g. `randomstroll` also matches
`water_avoiding_random_stroll`) are re-added from what the mob had before clearing.

### Patrol, guard and home distance

```yaml
Patrol:
  Points: [ "100 64 200", "world 110 64 200" ]
  Loop: true
  Wait: 3
Guard:
  Radius: 20
MaxHomeDistance: 60
```

`Patrol` walks the points while the mob has no target (`Loop`, `Wait` in seconds), `Guard` sends it back to its spawn point once it is further away than the radius, `MaxHomeDistance` teleports it back. The spawn point is saved on the mob. Details in the [wiki](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki/Mobs).

### Groups and leaders

```yaml
Group: orcs
AlertRadius: 20
Leader: { Mob: orc_chief, Distance: 4, Range: 32, OnLeaderDeath: HOME }
```

Members of a `Group` take the attacker as target when a packmate is damaged (within `AlertRadius`, default 16). `Leader` makes a mob follow the nearest mob with that id; `OnLeaderDeath` is `FIND`, `STAY` or `HOME`. Details in the [wiki](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki/Mobs).

## Items

`items/*.yml` (and each pack's `Items/`) define items the same way MythicMobs does -
every top-level key with an `Id:` is one item:

```yaml
nm_pack_starter_pack:
  Id: PAPER                  # the Vanilla material
  Model: 635000              # CustomModelData the resource pack switches on
  Display: '&9Starter &fBooster Pack'
  Lore:
  - '&7Contains &f&l2 &r&7Trading Cards!'
  Skills:
  - skill{s=nm_pack_open_starter_pack;cd=1} @self ~onUse
  - takeitem{i=nm_pack_starter_pack;a=1} @self ~onUse
```

`/bettermob give <item> [player] [amount]` hands them out. Right-clicking one runs its
`~onUse` skills with the player as caster. The same item ids can be used as a mob's
`Options.ItemHead`. Furniture settings on an item (`Type: FURNITURE`) are ignored.

## Drop tables

`droptables/*.yml` (and each pack's `DropTables/`) define what a mob drops on death:

```yaml
nm_bison_drops:
  MinItems: 2           # at least / at most this many item entries drop
  MaxItems: 3
  Drops:
  - EXP 5-11 100%       # experience, not counted towards MinItems/MaxItems
  - LEATHER 4-5 80%     # <item> <amount or range> <chance>
  - nm_bison_fur 2-3 40%
```

A line is `<what> <amount> <chance>`. The amount is a number or a range (`2-4`) and the chance is
`80%` or `0.8`; both are optional (1 piece, 100%). `<what>` is `EXP`, another drop table, a
registered [item](#items) or a Vanilla material. Point a mob at a table (or write drops directly)
with `Drops:`:

```yaml
Drops:
- nm_bison_drops
- DIAMOND 1 5%
```

A mob with a `Drops:` list loses its vanilla drops **and** vanilla experience automatically, only
its own drops remain. `PreventOtherDrops: true` does the same for mobs without any `Drops:`.

## Spawn eggs

`/bettermob egg <mob> [player] [amount]` gives a spawn egg item for a registered mob (up to 64). Right-clicking
a block with it spawns that mob on the clicked face and uses up the egg (not in creative mode). The egg is
the vanilla spawn egg of the mob's `Type` (a zombie egg for types that have none), named after the mob's
`Display:`, with the mob id stored on the item so it keeps working after restarts and reloads. It never spawns
the vanilla mob: using it on an entity or a spawner and shooting it from a dispenser do nothing.

```yaml
Egg:                        # optional
  Material: PIG_SPAWN_EGG   # any material; default is the egg of the mob's Type
  Name: '&6Goblin Egg'      # default is the mob's Display
```

## Skills

Skill files under `skills/` hold named, reusable skills (a file may contain several,
e.g. a `_parse`/`_activate` pair):

```yaml
my_skill_parse:
  TargetConditions:
    - blocktype{type=OAK_LOG,SPRUCE_LOG}
  Skills:
    - CancelEvent
    - skill{s=my_skill_activate}

my_skill_activate:
  Skills:
    - sound{s=entity.rabbit.ambient;p=1;v=1} @self
    - delay 8
    - potion{type=SLOW;duration=20;level=5} @self
```

A mob's own `Skills:` list can call a named skill (`skill{s=<id>}`) or run a mechanic
directly, with a trigger suffix:

```yaml
Skills:
  - skill{s=my_skill_parse} ~onInteract
  - model{mid=my_model} @self ~onSpawn
  - sound{s=entity.pig.hurt} @self ~onDamaged
```

**Triggers:** `~onSpawn`, `~onLoad` (chunk/restart rehydration), `~onInteract`,
`~onDamaged`, `~onAttack` (melee hits only, projectiles don't count), `~onShoot` (bow/crossbow
shot, `CancelEvent` stops the vanilla arrow), `~onDeath`, `~onHealth<50%` (also `<=`, `>`, `>=` and absolute values like `~onHealth<=10`; fires once when the mob's health crosses the threshold and again after it has healed back across it), `~onTarget` (a target is acquired, `@trigger` is the target), `~onLoseTarget`, `~onEnterCombat` (first target after being idle), `~onExitCombat` (no target for 5 seconds), `~onKill` (the mob killed something, `@trigger` is the victim), `~onTimer:<ticks>` (repeats). Triggers fire for any
living entity, armor stands included. On items: `~onUse` (right click, see [Items](#items)).

**Mechanics:** `sound`, `model` (attach via BetterModel), `modelengine` (attach the
same way via ModelEngine instead — pick whichever engine that mob's model is
registered in), `mountmodel` (BetterModel seats — the rider gets actual WASD
control), `potion`, `look`, `breakblock`, `state` (plays a BetterModel animation),
`summon` (spawns another registered mob), `remove`, `command`, `gcd`, `randomskill`
(`s=a,b,c`), `skill`, `sudoskill` (run a skill with the target as caster), `cancelevent`,

`velocity` degrees/tick), `loot` (`table=<drop table>` or `vanilla=<loot table>`, `lootingmodifier`, `mode=drop`: roll a table and give it to the target player or drop it), `takeitem` (`i=<item>;a=<amount>`, removes a registered item
from the target player), `ignite` (`t` ticks), `setvariable` / `addvariable` (`var`, `value`, `type=INTEGER|FLOAT|STRING`, see Skill variables below), `heal` (`a`, capped at max health), `teleport` (the caster goes to the targeted location or entity, e.g. `@Target`), `explosion` (`yield`, `bd=true` block damage, `fire=true`), `lightning` (`damage=true` for a real strike), `setspeed` (`s`, movement speed attribute), `setai` (`ai=false` switches the AI off), `stun` (`d` ticks; `ai` default true disables the AI, `g=true` also turns gravity off, `f=true` holds the mob still, `state=<animation>` plays that BetterModel animation), `velocity` (`m=SET|ADD|MULTIPLY|DIVIDE`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `repeat`, `repeatInterval`), `freeze` (`ticks`, powder-snow effect),

runs once at the targeter's location, `yo` shifts it up; with `md` ticks, `ot=[ ... ]` repeats every `i` ticks
(default 20) and `oe=[ ... ]` runs at the end; stops early if the caster dies; with `oh=[ ... ]` an invisible, unbreakable body is placed at the totem for `md` ticks (default 100) and the lines run whenever someone hits it, with the attacker as target).

`<caster.damage>` and `<caster.name>` inside mechanic parameters are replaced with the caster's
attack damage and name. A skill may set `Cooldown: <seconds>` (per caster).

Every mechanic accepts `delay=<ticks>` (run this line later without holding up the rest)
and `cd=<seconds>` (cooldown per caster). `skill`/`randomskill` read their skill ids from
`s=`, `skill=` or `skills=`; `summon` from `type=` (or `t=`/`mob=`).

`modelengine{mid=<id>}` needs the [ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/)
plugin and uses its own model IDs — these are separate registries from BetterModel's,
so a model has to exist in whichever engine you point at it.

**Factions:** players can belong to a faction too: give them the permission `bettermob.faction.<name>` (lower case) or list them under `factions:` in `config.yml` (player name or UUID). Mobs of that faction then ignore them, and they can't hurt those mobs. Without either, players are in no faction (ops included).

**Conditions:** `offgcd`, `onground`, `health{h=<50%}` (caster health; absolute value or percent, also `>10`, `<=5`, `20-40`), `lineofsight` (alias `los`, the caster sees the trigger/target), `world{w=world,world_nether}`, `biome{b=DESERT,PLAINS}`, `time{t=day|night|<ticks or range>}`, `variable{var=caster.phase;value=>=2}`, `sneaking` (the caster is a sneaking player), `chance{chance=0.75}`, `hastag{t=...}`, `hasaura{n=...}`, `faction{faction=Elite,Other}` (the caster's, or each candidate's inside a multi-target targeter), `onblock{b=...}` (block under the caster), `blocktype{type=...}`, `skillOnCooldown{skill=...}`, `distance{d=0-6}` (also `>3`, `<=5`) to the trigger/target. A skill's `Conditions`/`TargetConditions` entry may end in `castinstead <skill>` to cast that skill instead when it holds. Any mechanic line can
end with `?condition{...}` (or `?!condition{...}` to negate) to run only when that
check passes; unsupported conditions
are logged and treated as passing, so the line still runs.

**Targeters:** `@self`, `@trigger`/`@target`, `@ObstructingBlock`, `@Forward{f=1.5;
uel=true;yoffset=-1;rotate=-22}` (point in front of the caster, `rotate` swings it sideways,
positive = right), `@SelfLocation{x;y;z}` (caster position, optionally shifted), `@Caster`/`@Mob` (the caster), `@Origin` (a totem's location), `@Location{x;y;z;w}`, `@TargetLocation`, `@Owner`/`@Parent` (the entity whose `summon` created the caster), `@PIR{r=2}` (nearest player within `r`), `@PlayersInRadius{r}`, `@EntitiesNearOrigin{r=4;Conditions=[ - isPlayer{} true - isCaster{} false]}` (alias `@ENO`, around a totem's location) and `@EntitiesInRadius` (`@EIR`/`@LEIR`, around the caster) hit every matching entity; all of them take `limit=<n>` and `sort=nearest|farthest|random` and `Conditions=[ ... ]` with `isPlayer`, `isCaster`, `isMob`, `hasTag`, `faction` and every skill condition (`health`, `world`, `biome`, `time`, `lineofsight`, `distance`, `onground`, `hasaura`, `chance`, ...), which then test the candidate instead of the caster (`distance` and `lineofsight` measure to the caster), `@ModelPart{p=<bone>}` (position of a BetterModel bone, falls back to chest height). A skill line without a targeter inherits the target of the line that called it.

Unknown mechanics/conditions/targeters are logged with a clear warning and skipped
rather than crashing the skill or the server.

## Skill arguments

A skill can take values: every parameter of `skill{s=name;...}`, `sudoskill{...}` and `randomskill{...}` other than `s`, `skill`, `skills`, `sync`, `delay` and `cd` is passed to the called skill, and `<arg.name>` in its mechanic parameters (also in its inline skills) is replaced by the value.

```yaml
heal_pulse:
  Arguments:            # optional defaults
    amount: 2
  Skills:
    - heal{amount=<arg.amount>} @self
```

`skill{s=heal_pulse;amount=6} @self` heals 6, `skill{s=heal_pulse} @self` heals 2. Arguments are not passed on to the skills that skill calls: repeat them explicitly (`skill{s=other;amount=<arg.amount>}`). An argument that was not passed and has no default stays as `<arg.name>` and is logged once. Values are inserted as plain text: braces, brackets, `;`, `=`, quotes, `%` and control characters are removed, so an argument can never add skill lines or trigger a command.

## Skill variables

`setvariable{var=hits;value=1;type=INTEGER}` stores a value, `addvariable{var=hits;value=1}` adds to a number
(a missing variable counts as 0), `?variable{var=hits;value=>=3}` tests it and `<skill.hits>` /
`<var.hits>` insert it into mechanic parameters.

- `var=name` lives for the current skill run (shared with the skills and inline skills it starts, kept across `delay`). Read it with `<skill.name>`.
- `var=caster.name` belongs to the caster and lives as long as the mob (cleared when it is removed and on `/bettermob reload`, not saved over restarts). Read it with `<var.name>`.
- Names are letters, digits and `_`, up to 32 characters, case-insensitive; a scope holds at most 64 variables.
- The condition compares numbers (`>3`, `<=5`, `2-4`, `7`) when the stored value is a number, otherwise text (case-insensitive). A missing variable counts as 0 for number tests and never equals a text.
- Values are inserted as plain text: braces, brackets, `;`, `=`, quotes, `%` and control characters are removed, so a variable can never add skill lines or trigger a command. An unset variable is inserted as `0`.

```yaml
Skills:
  - addvariable{var=caster.hits;value=1} @self ~onDamaged
  - skill{s=enrage} @self ~onDamaged ?variable{var=caster.hits;value=>=5}
```

## PlaceholderAPI

[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) is optional. When it is installed:

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| `%bettermob_mobs_alive%` | Number of loaded BetterMob mobs |
| `%bettermob_mobs_alive_<id>%` | Number of loaded mobs with that id |
| `%bettermob_loaded_mobs%` | Registered mob definitions |
| `%bettermob_loaded_skills%` | Registered skills |
| `%bettermob_loaded_items%` | Registered items |
| `%bettermob_kills_total%` | The player's kills of BetterMob mobs |
| `%bettermob_kills_<mob>%` | The player's kills of that mob id |
| `%bettermob_top_<n>_name%` / `%bettermob_top_<n>_kills%` | Name and kills of place `n` in the all-mob top list (`-` and `0` when empty) |

Placeholders from any expansion are also resolved in a mob's `Display:` name and in the text of `command{c=...}` and `message{m=...}`; the player used is the trigger if it is a player, otherwise the caster.

## Developer API

BetterMob registers a `BetterMobAPI` Bukkit service you can use from your own plugins.
Add `depend: [BetterMob]` (or `softdepend`) to your `plugin.yml` and compile against the
BetterMob jar (`provided` scope). Everything public lives in `eu.northsoft.bettermob.api`.

### Getting the API

Releases are automatic: whenever a push to `main` carries a `<version>` in `pom.xml`
that has no `v<version>` tag yet, the workflow creates the tag and a GitHub Release with
the jar, and publishes it to GitHub Packages (Maven). To release, just bump the version
in `pom.xml` and push.

**JitPack** (no login needed):

```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.HyperGaming99</groupId>
    <artifactId>bettermob</artifactId>
    <version>v1.1.8</version> <!-- a tag -->
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

**GitHub Packages** (needs a `read:packages` token in your `settings.xml`, server id `github`):

```xml
<repository>
    <id>github</id>
    <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.northsoft</groupId>
    <artifactId>bettermob</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.8</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

```java
BetterMobAPI api = BetterMobAPI.get();

api.getMobs();                                   // all registered mob definitions (MobInfo)
api.spawn("zombie_brute", player.getLocation()); // Optional<LivingEntity>
api.isBetterMob(entity);                         // is this one of ours?
api.getMobInfo(entity);                          // its definition
api.runSkill("wumpus_wave", player);             // run a skill with any LivingEntity as caster
api.reload();                                    // same as /bettermob reload
```

**Events** (`eu.northsoft.bettermob.api.event`): `BetterMobSpawnEvent` and
`BetterMobDeathEvent`, both exposing the entity and its `MobInfo`, and two cancellable events (1.1.8 or newer):
`BetterMobDamageEvent` (a BetterMob mob takes or deals melee or projectile damage; `getOther()`, `isMobVictim()`,
`getCause()`, `getDamage()`/`setDamage()`) and `BetterMobSkillEvent` (a named skill is about to run, after its
conditions and before its cooldown starts; `getSkillId()`, `getCaster()`, `getTrigger()`, `getMob()`). Nothing is
built when no plugin listens to them.

**Custom mechanics:** register your own mechanic and use it in skill lines like any
built-in one (`heal{amount=4} @self ~onDamaged`). Built-ins can't be overridden, and
your mechanics are removed automatically when your plugin is disabled.

```java
api.registerMechanic(this, "heal", ctx -> {
    double amount = Double.parseDouble(ctx.params().getOrDefault("amount", "2"));
    if (ctx.target() instanceof LivingEntity living) living.heal(amount);
});
```

**Custom conditions, targeters and placeholders** (BetterMob 1.1.7 or newer; the 1.1.6.x builds don't have these methods): the same registration works for the other
building blocks of a skill line, which is what a plugin that adds its own mobs or pets needs.
Built-in names can't be taken, entries are removed when your plugin is disabled, and a
`RuntimeException` is caught and logged.

```java
api.registerCondition(this, "petlevel", ctx -> level(ctx.caster()) >= Integer.parseInt(ctx.params().getOrDefault("min", "1")));
api.registerTargeter(this, "petowner", ctx -> List.of(ownerOf(ctx.caster())));
api.registerPlaceholder(this, "pet", (key, ctx) -> key.equals("health") ? String.valueOf(ctx.caster().getHealth()) : null);
```

```yaml
Skills:
  - heal{amount=<pet.health>} @PetOwner ~onTimer:100 ?petlevel{min=3}
```

A placeholder `<namespace.key>` is resolved in every mechanic parameter. Its value is inserted as plain
text: braces, brackets, `;`, `=`, quotes, `%` and control characters are removed so a value can never add
skill lines or trigger a command. `caster` and `target` are reserved namespaces.

### Example plugin

[`examples/api-example`](examples/api-example) is a small plugin built on this API: it registers a `heal{amount=4}` mechanic, a `?daytime` condition, a `@NearestPlayer` targeter and an `<example.world>` placeholder, listens to `BetterMobSpawnEvent` and `BetterMobDeathEvent` and has a `/apiexample <mob>` command that spawns a mob. Its damage and skill event listener (`ModernEvents`) needs BetterMob 1.1.8 and is only built with the `local` profile.

```bash
mvn -f examples/api-example/pom.xml package
```

This resolves `com.github.HyperGaming99:bettermob:v1.1.7.1` from JitPack. To compile it against your own checkout instead:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests
mvn -f examples/api-example/pom.xml -Plocal -Dbettermob.version=<version in pom.xml> package
```

The workflow builds it that way on every push and pull request, so it keeps compiling with the API.

## Persistence

Mob state (model tracker, threat table, timers) lives in memory and is tied to the
mob's UUID, tagged via a small PDC marker so it survives a server restart or chunk
unload/reload — `~onLoad` fires again and the model gets reattached automatically.
