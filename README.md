# BetterMob

A Paper plugin for registering custom mobs in YAML — MysticMobs/MythicMobs-style —
and rendering them through [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) or
[ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/). Includes a
small skill engine for AI behavior, triggers, and MythicMobs-compatible skill syntax.

## Requirements

- Paper (or a fork) **1.21+** — [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia) is supported too
- Java 21
- [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) and/or
  [ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/) installed
  and enabled if you want mobs to actually render a custom model — without either,
  mobs still spawn and run their AI/skills, just with their vanilla appearance. A mob
  can use either engine (or both, for different mobs), chosen per `Skills:` line via
  `model{}` (BetterModel) or `modelengine{}` (ModelEngine).

## Model engine support

A mob's model comes from [BetterModel](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bettermodel) or
[ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/). Both are optional and
independent: each uses its own model IDs, and a model must exist in the engine you point at it.

| Feature | BetterModel | ModelEngine |
|---|---|---|
| Attach a model with `model{mid=...}` | Yes | - |
| Attach a model with `modelengine{mid=...}` | - | Yes |
| `Model:` field in the mob file (automatic attach on spawn/load) | Yes | No, use a `modelengine{}` line |
| Hide the vanilla body while a model is attached | Yes | Yes |
| Model reattached after restart/chunk load (`~onLoad`) | Yes | Yes, with a `modelengine{}` line on `~onLoad` |
| `state{s=...}` plays a model animation | Yes | No |
| `mountmodel{seat=...}` (rideable seats with WASD control) | Yes | No |
| `@ModelPart{p=<bone>}` targeter (bone position) | Yes | No, falls back to chest height |
| `bodyrotation{...}` head/body turn limits | Yes | No, ignored |

Mechanics that need BetterModel simply do nothing on a ModelEngine mob (`mountmodel` logs a
warning) instead of failing. Using both engines for different mobs on one server works.

## Building

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Produces `target/bettermob-<version>.jar`. Drop it into your server's `plugins/`
folder.

## Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

JUnit 5 tests cover the line parsers (skill steps, conditions, mob triggers, drop lines, inline
skills). `PackFilesTest` also parses every line of the YAML files shipped in `src/main/resources`
and of any pack placed under `src/test/resources/packs/` - use the usual `Mobs/`, `Items/`,
`Skills/` and `DropTables/` folder names. The workflow runs `mvn test` on every push and pull
request, and a failing test stops the build and the release.

The Java code is kept free of comments. The `Strip code comments` workflow runs
`.github/scripts/strip_comments.py` on the Java files a pull request changes and commits
`Remove code comments` to the branch (pull requests from forks need the `PR_PUSH_TOKEN` secret and
maintainer edits enabled; without them the check fails with the list of files).

## Code layout

Everything lives under `eu.northsoft.bettermob`: `api`/`api.event` (public API), `command`, `mob`,
`skill` (engine and parser) with `skill.mechanic`, `skill.condition` and `skill.target` (one class per
mechanic, condition and targeter behind the `Mechanic`, `SkillCondition` and `Targeter` interfaces),
`ai`, `model`, `drop`, `item`, `pack`, `lang`, `debug`, `integration` (PlaceholderAPI), `service` and `util`.
To add a mechanic, implement `Mechanic` and register it in `BuiltinMechanics.registerAll`; see the
[Development](https://github.com/HyperGaming99/bettermob/wiki/Development) wiki page.

## Releases

Every push to `main` and every PR triggers a GitHub Actions build (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
that compiles the jar and uploads it as a build artifact. A release is cut automatically
when the version in `pom.xml` changes (see "Getting the API").

### Dev builds

Pushing to the `dev` branch builds the jar and publishes it as the **Dev build**
pre-release (tag `dev-build`). There is only ever one: each push replaces it with the newest jar
(`bettermob-<version>-dev-<commit>.jar`). It is unstable and meant for testing, the
tagged releases above are the stable ones.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/bettermob spawn <id> [amount]` | Spawn a registered mob at your location |
| `/bettermob list` | List all registered mob IDs |
| `/bettermob packs` | List discovered packs and whether they're enabled |
| `/bettermob reload` | Reload config, mobs, skills, and packs |
| `/bettermob skill <id> [player]` | Manually run a registered skill, bypassing its normal triggers |
| `/bettermob give <item> [player] [amount]` | Give a registered item (see [Items](#items)) |
| `/bettermob killall [mob\|*] [world]` | Remove all living BetterMob mobs, or only one type and/or one world, and report how many |
| `/bettermob spawner create <id> <mob> [radius] [interval] [max]` | Create a spawner at your position; `remove <id>` and `list` manage them |
| `/bettermob stats [on\|off\|reset]` | Show living mobs per type, running timers, loaded skills and packs; `on`/`off` switch the skill timing, `reset` clears it (permission `bettermob.debug`) |
| `/bettermob debug [off\|info\|verbose\|filter <id>\|filter clear\|chat]` | Show or change the debug output (permission `bettermob.debug`, part of `bettermob.admin`) |

Alias: `/bmob`.

| Permission | Allows | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `bettermob.admin` | everything below | op |
| `bettermob.spawn` | `/bettermob spawn` | op |
| `bettermob.list` | `/bettermob list` and `/bettermob packs` | op |
| `bettermob.reload` | `/bettermob reload` | op |
| `bettermob.skill` | `/bettermob skill` | op |
| `bettermob.give` | `/bettermob give` | op |
| `bettermob.killall` | `/bettermob killall` | op |
| `bettermob.spawner` | `/bettermob spawner` | op |
| `bettermob.debug` | `/bettermob debug` | op |

`bettermob.admin` is the parent of all the others. Without a node the subcommand is refused, left out of the help and left out of tab completion. `bettermob.faction.<name>` (see `factions` in `config.yml`) is unrelated to the commands.

**Reload:** `/bettermob reload` also updates mobs that are already alive. Each one is bound to the new definition of the same id: name, health cap, attack, speed and the options are applied again, its timers are restarted (the old ones are cancelled, so nothing runs twice), its auras and global cooldown are cleared, the model is attached again and the `~onLoad` skills run again. AI goals are applied again only when `AIGoalSelectors` or `AITargetSelectors` changed and the new list starts with `clear`; goals an earlier `clear` removed cannot come back until the mob is respawned. A mob whose definition was removed keeps the old one and a warning is logged. Totem bodies that are already in the world run out on their own.

**Killall:** `/bettermob killall` removes every loaded living BetterMob mob; `<mob>` limits it to one id (`*` means all) and `<world>` to one world. Mobs in unloaded chunks are not touched. Without a mob id it also removes helper armor stands (the hit bodies of `totem` skills). Those carry the scoreboard tag `bettermob_helper`, and only entities with that tag are ever removed. Leftover helpers are also removed on startup and whenever a chunk loads.

**Spawners:** `/bettermob spawner create camp goblin 6 20 4` makes a spawner at your position that spawns `goblin` at a random ground spot within 6 blocks every 20 seconds (defaults: radius 5, 30 s, max 3) while a player is within 32 blocks, and never lets more than 4 of its loaded mobs live at once. They are stored in `plugins/BetterMob/spawners.yml` (`mob`, `world`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `radius`, `interval`, `max`, `player-range`) and reloaded with `/bettermob reload`. Spawned mobs carry the scoreboard tag `bettermob_spawner:<id>`, which is how its mobs are counted again after a restart or when their chunk loads.

**Stats:** `/bettermob stats` shows the living BetterMob mobs per type, the running mob timers and the loaded skills and packs. With `Stats: on` in `config.yml` (or `/bettermob stats on`) it also measures every skill run and lists the 10 skills with the most total time (calls, average, maximum), plus the delayed steps that are still waiting. A run is measured up to its first `delay` and includes the skills it starts in the same tick. `StatsWarnMillis` (default 50, 0 turns it off) logs a console warning when a single run takes longer. While stats are off nothing is measured or counted. Delayed steps whose mob disappears before they run are not subtracted, so `reset` now and then. Uses the permission `bettermob.debug`.

**Debug:** set `Debug: off|info|verbose` in `config.yml`, or change it at runtime with `/bettermob debug`.
`info` logs every trigger that fires (and whether the event was cancelled), every skill run with the reason it
stopped (conditions, target conditions, cooldown, `castinstead`) and AI goals that are missing (with the goals
the mob type has). `verbose` adds every mechanic with its targeter, target count and parameters, `cancelskill`,
bone offsets, `shoot` and `totem`. `filter <id>` limits the output to one mob id, skill id or player name,
`chat` also sends it to you in chat. Nothing is built or logged while debug is off.

## Languages

Console and command messages live in `plugins/BetterMob/lang/<code>.yml`. `en` and `de` are written
there on first start. Pick one with `Language:` in `config.yml` (default `en`) and apply it with
`/bettermob reload`.

To add a language, copy `lang/en.yml` to `lang/<code>.yml`, translate the values and set
`Language: <code>`. Keys you leave out fall back to the bundled English text. Values use `&` colour codes
and placeholders such as `{mob}`, `{skill}`, `{folder}` or `{error}`, keep the placeholders of the English
original. Debug output (`/bettermob debug`) stays English.

## Folder layout

```
plugins/BetterMob/
├── config.yml          # DisabledPacks: [...]
├── lang/                 # message files (en.yml, de.yml, your own)
│   └── en.yml
├── mobs/                # default mob files
│   └── my_mob.yml
├── skills/               # default skill files
│   └── my_skill.yml
├── items/                # default item files
│   └── my_item.yml
├── droptables/           # default drop tables
│   └── my_drops.yml
└── packs/
    └── some_pack/
        ├── mobs/
        ├── skills/
        ├── items/
        └── droptables/
```

The flat `mobs/`/`skills/` folders are always loaded. Each subfolder under `packs/`
is its own bundle with its own `mobs/`/`skills/` (case-insensitive — `Mobs`/`Skills`
work too, matching how most MythicMobs packs are shipped). Disable a pack by adding
its folder name to `DisabledPacks` in `config.yml`.

If two mobs or skills share an ID, the one loaded first wins; the rest are skipped
with a console warning.

## Defining a mob

A mob file can define **one mob** (fields directly at the file root, ID = filename)
or **multiple mobs** (each top-level key is its own mob, like a classic MysticMobs
`mobs.yml`):

```yaml
# mobs/skeleton_knight.yml — one mob, ID = "skeleton_knight"
Type: SKELETON
Display: '&c&lSkeleton Knight'
Model: skeleton_knight      # BetterModel model ID; defaults to the mob ID
Health: 60
Damage: 8
RemoveAi: false
Faction: Elite              # mobs of one faction never target or hurt each other
Equipment:                  # item or material : slot (HAND, OFFHAND, HEAD, CHEST, LEGS, FEET)
  - BOW:HAND
  - my_helmet:HEAD

AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear
  - randomstroll            # matched against the mob's actual vanilla goals
AITargetSelectors:
  - clear

Options:
  Collidable: true
  MovementSpeed: 0.25
  PreventOtherDrops: true
  Silent: true
  PreventRenaming: false
  PreventLeashing: false
  AlwaysShowName: false
  PreventSunburn: true       # zombies/skeletons won't burn in daylight
  Invincible: false
  # Armor-stand style mobs (e.g. floating, hands-off display cards):
  Invisible: false           # hide the body, equipment stays visible
  CanMove: true              # false = no AI and no gravity (floats in place)
  Interactable: true         # false = right clicks / equipment swaps are cancelled
  Marker: false              # armor stands only: no hitbox
  ItemHead: my_item          # a registered item (see Items) worn on the head
  KnockbackResistance: 1
  FollowRange: 15
  Scale: 0.5
  PreventItemPickup: true

Modules:
  ThreatTable: true           # retarget to whoever dealt the most damage
  BossBar:                    # health bar for players nearby
    Title: '&c<mob.name> &7<mob.hp>/<mob.maxhp>'
    Range: 64
    Color: RED
    Style: SOLID

DamageModifiers:
  - FIRE 1.2                  # multiply fire damage taken by 1.2

Skills:
  - skill{s=my_skill_id} ~onInteract
  - sound{s=entity.skeleton.ambient;p=1.0;v=1} @self ~onTimer:200
```

`Modules: BossBar:` shows a boss bar with the mob's health to every player within `Range` blocks (same world). `BossBar: true` uses the defaults.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Title` | `<mob.name>` | Text of the bar; `&` colour codes, `<mob.name>` (the `Display`), `<mob.id>`, `<mob.hp>` and `<mob.maxhp>` (rounded up) and PlaceholderAPI placeholders without a player |
| `Range` | `64` | Blocks around the mob in which players see the bar |
| `Color` | `RED` | `PINK`, `BLUE`, `RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `PURPLE` or `WHITE` |
| `Style` | `SOLID` | `SOLID`, `SEGMENTED_6`, `SEGMENTED_10`, `SEGMENTED_12` or `SEGMENTED_20` |
| `CreateFog` / `DarkenSky` / `PlayMusic` | `false` | Boss bar effects of the client |

The bar updates twice a second and is removed when the mob dies, despawns, its chunk unloads, on `/bettermob reload` (it is rebuilt from the new definition) and when the plugin is disabled. An unknown `Color` or `Style` logs a warning and uses the default.

A file with multiple mobs looks like:

```yaml
nm_mustang_red:
  Type: IRON_GOLEM
  ...
nm_mustang_cyan:
  Type: IRON_GOLEM
  ...
```

`AIGoalSelectors`/`AITargetSelectors` only work with goals the mob's vanilla AI
actually has — Paper can reuse existing goals, not invent new ones. `clear` removes
the category first; named goals (matched loosely, e.g. `randomstroll` also matches
`water_avoiding_random_stroll`) are re-added from what the mob had before clearing.

## Items

`items/*.yml` (and each pack's `Items/`) define items the same way MythicMobs does -
every top-level key with an `Id:` is one item:

```yaml
nm_pack_starter_pack:
  Id: PAPER                  # the Vanilla material
  Model: 635000              # CustomModelData the resource pack switches on
  Display: '&9Starter &fBooster Pack'
  Lore:
  - '&7Contains &f&l2 &r&7Trading Cards!'
  Skills:
  - skill{s=nm_pack_open_starter_pack;cd=1} @self ~onUse
  - takeitem{i=nm_pack_starter_pack;a=1} @self ~onUse
```

`/bettermob give <item> [player] [amount]` hands them out. Right-clicking one runs its
`~onUse` skills with the player as caster. The same item ids can be used as a mob's
`Options.ItemHead`. Furniture settings on an item (`Type: FURNITURE`) are ignored.

## Drop tables

`droptables/*.yml` (and each pack's `DropTables/`) define what a mob drops on death:

```yaml
nm_bison_drops:
  MinItems: 2           # at least / at most this many item entries drop
  MaxItems: 3
  Drops:
  - EXP 5-11 100%       # experience, not counted towards MinItems/MaxItems
  - LEATHER 4-5 80%     # <item> <amount or range> <chance>
  - nm_bison_fur 2-3 40%
```

A line is `<what> <amount> <chance>`. The amount is a number or a range (`2-4`) and the chance is
`80%` or `0.8`; both are optional (1 piece, 100%). `<what>` is `EXP`, another drop table, a
registered [item](#items) or a Vanilla material. Point a mob at a table (or write drops directly)
with `Drops:`:

```yaml
Drops:
- nm_bison_drops
- DIAMOND 1 5%
```

A mob with a `Drops:` list loses its vanilla drops **and** vanilla experience automatically, only
its own drops remain. `PreventOtherDrops: true` does the same for mobs without any `Drops:`.

## Skills

Skill files under `skills/` hold named, reusable skills (a file may contain several,
e.g. a `_parse`/`_activate` pair):

```yaml
my_skill_parse:
  TargetConditions:
    - blocktype{type=OAK_LOG,SPRUCE_LOG}
  Skills:
    - CancelEvent
    - skill{s=my_skill_activate}

my_skill_activate:
  Skills:
    - sound{s=entity.rabbit.ambient;p=1;v=1} @self
    - delay 8
    - potion{type=SLOW;duration=20;level=5} @self
```

A mob's own `Skills:` list can call a named skill (`skill{s=<id>}`) or run a mechanic
directly, with a trigger suffix:

```yaml
Skills:
  - skill{s=my_skill_parse} ~onInteract
  - model{mid=my_model} @self ~onSpawn
  - sound{s=entity.pig.hurt} @self ~onDamaged
```

**Triggers:** `~onSpawn`, `~onLoad` (chunk/restart rehydration), `~onInteract`,
`~onDamaged`, `~onAttack` (melee hits only, projectiles don't count), `~onShoot` (bow/crossbow
shot, `CancelEvent` stops the vanilla arrow), `~onDeath`, `~onTimer:<ticks>` (repeats). Triggers fire for any
living entity, armor stands included. On items: `~onUse` (right click, see [Items](#items)).

**Mechanics:** `sound`, `model` (attach via BetterModel), `modelengine` (attach the
same way via ModelEngine instead — pick whichever engine that mob's model is
registered in), `mountmodel` (BetterModel seats — the rider gets actual WASD
control), `potion`, `look`, `breakblock`, `state` (plays a BetterModel animation),
`summon` (spawns another registered mob), `remove`, `command`, `gcd`, `randomskill`
(`s=a,b,c`), `skill`, `sudoskill` (run a skill with the target as caster), `cancelevent`,
`cancelskill`, `equip` (`item=BOW:HAND`), `addtag`/`removetag`, `damage` (`amount`), `throw` (`velocity`, `velocityY`, both scaled by 1/10), `lunge` (`velocity`),
`setblock` (`m`), `effect:particles` (`p`, `amount`, `hS`, `vS`, `speed`, `y` offset, `repeat`, `repeatInterval`; alias `e:p`),
`effect:particlering` (`particle`, `radius`, `points`, ...), `spin` (`duration` ticks,
`velocity` degrees/tick), `takeitem` (`i=<item>;a=<amount>`, removes a registered item
from the target player), `ignite` (`t` ticks), `heal` (`a`, capped at max health), `teleport` (the caster goes to the targeted location or entity, e.g. `@Target`), `explosion` (`yield`, `bd=true` block damage, `fire=true`), `lightning` (`damage=true` for a real strike), `setspeed` (`s`, movement speed attribute), `setai` (`ai=false` switches the AI off), `stun` (`d` ticks; `ai` default true disables the AI, `g=true` also turns gravity off, `f=true` holds the mob still, `state=<animation>` plays that BetterModel animation), `velocity` (`m=SET|ADD|MULTIPLY|DIVIDE`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `repeat`, `repeatInterval`), `freeze` (`ticks`, powder-snow effect),
`message` (`m`, to the target player, `&` colors, `<caster.name>`, `<target.name>`), `setNoDamageTicks` (`ticks`), `onDamaged`/`onAttack`/`onDeath`/`onShoot`/`aura` (`auraName`, `time`, `cE`, `oS`, `oE`, `oT`, `i`, `oH`: a timed aura that runs `oS` at start, `oE` at end, `oT` every `i` ticks and `oH` on its event, `cE=true` cancels that event meanwhile), `bodyrotation` (`headUneven`, `bodyUneven`, `minHead`, `maxHead`, `minBody`, `maxBody`, `delay`; BetterModel only), `shoot` (`type=arrow|spectral_arrow|trident|snowball|egg|fireball|smallfireball`, `velocity`, `damage`, `spread` degrees, `gravity=false`; `oh=[ ... ]` runs on a hit with the hit entity as target, `oe=[ ... ]` when it lands anywhere, `ot=[ ... ]` every `i` ticks (default 5) in flight), `totem` (`os=[ ... ]`
runs once at the targeter's location, `yo` shifts it up; with `md` ticks, `ot=[ ... ]` repeats every `i` ticks
(default 20) and `oe=[ ... ]` runs at the end; stops early if the caster dies; with `oh=[ ... ]` an invisible, unbreakable body is placed at the totem for `md` ticks (default 100) and the lines run whenever someone hits it, with the attacker as target).

`<caster.damage>` and `<caster.name>` inside mechanic parameters are replaced with the caster's
attack damage and name. A skill may set `Cooldown: <seconds>` (per caster).

Every mechanic accepts `delay=<ticks>` (run this line later without holding up the rest)
and `cd=<seconds>` (cooldown per caster). `skill`/`randomskill` read their skill ids from
`s=`, `skill=` or `skills=`; `summon` from `type=` (or `t=`/`mob=`).

`modelengine{mid=<id>}` needs the [ModelEngine](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/model-engine-4.108821/)
plugin and uses its own model IDs — these are separate registries from BetterModel's,
so a model has to exist in whichever engine you point at it.

**Factions:** players can belong to a faction too: give them the permission `bettermob.faction.<name>` (lower case) or list them under `factions:` in `config.yml` (player name or UUID). Mobs of that faction then ignore them, and they can't hurt those mobs. Without either, players are in no faction (ops included).

**Conditions:** `offgcd`, `onground`, `health{h=<50%}` (caster health; absolute value or percent, also `>10`, `<=5`, `20-40`), `lineofsight` (alias `los`, the caster sees the trigger/target), `world{w=world,world_nether}`, `biome{b=DESERT,PLAINS}`, `time{t=day|night|<ticks or range>}`, `chance{chance=0.75}`, `hastag{t=...}`, `hasaura{n=...}`, `faction{faction=Elite,Other}` (the caster's, or each candidate's inside a multi-target targeter), `onblock{b=...}` (block under the caster), `blocktype{type=...}`, `skillOnCooldown{skill=...}`, `distance{d=0-6}` (also `>3`, `<=5`) to the trigger/target. A skill's `Conditions`/`TargetConditions` entry may end in `castinstead <skill>` to cast that skill instead when it holds. Any mechanic line can
end with `?condition{...}` (or `?!condition{...}` to negate) to run only when that
check passes; unsupported conditions (this plugin has no variable/faction system)
are logged and treated as passing, so the line still runs.

**Targeters:** `@self`, `@trigger`/`@target`, `@ObstructingBlock`, `@Forward{f=1.5;
uel=true;yoffset=-1;rotate=-22}` (point in front of the caster, `rotate` swings it sideways,
positive = right), `@SelfLocation{x;y;z}` (caster position, optionally shifted), `@Caster`/`@Mob` (the caster), `@Origin` (a totem's location), `@Location{x;y;z;w}`, `@TargetLocation`, `@Owner`/`@Parent` (the entity whose `summon` created the caster), `@PIR{r=2}` (nearest player within `r`), `@PlayersInRadius{r}`, `@EntitiesNearOrigin{r=4;Conditions=[ - isPlayer{} true - isCaster{} false]}` (alias `@ENO`, around a totem's location) and `@EntitiesInRadius` (`@EIR`/`@LEIR`, around the caster) hit every matching entity; all of them take `limit=<n>` and `sort=nearest|farthest|random` and conditions `isPlayer`, `isCaster`, `isMob`, `hasTag`, `faction`, `@ModelPart{p=<bone>}` (position of a BetterModel bone, falls back to chest height). A skill line without a targeter inherits the target of the line that called it.

Unknown mechanics/conditions/targeters are logged with a clear warning and skipped
rather than crashing the skill or the server.

## PlaceholderAPI

[PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) is optional. When it is installed:

| Placeholder | Value |
|---|---|
| `%bettermob_mobs_alive%` | Number of loaded BetterMob mobs |
| `%bettermob_mobs_alive_<id>%` | Number of loaded mobs with that id |
| `%bettermob_loaded_mobs%` | Registered mob definitions |
| `%bettermob_loaded_skills%` | Registered skills |
| `%bettermob_loaded_items%` | Registered items |

Placeholders from any expansion are also resolved in a mob's `Display:` name and in the text of `command{c=...}` and `message{m=...}`; the player used is the trigger if it is a player, otherwise the caster.

## Developer API

BetterMob registers a `BetterMobAPI` Bukkit service you can use from your own plugins.
Add `depend: [BetterMob]` (or `softdepend`) to your `plugin.yml` and compile against the
BetterMob jar (`provided` scope). Everything public lives in `eu.northsoft.bettermob.api`.

### Getting the API

Releases are automatic: whenever a push to `main` carries a `<version>` in `pom.xml`
that has no `v<version>` tag yet, the workflow creates the tag and a GitHub Release with
the jar, and publishes it to GitHub Packages (Maven). To release, just bump the version
in `pom.xml` and push.

**JitPack** (no login needed):

```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>

```java
BetterMobAPI api = BetterMobAPI.get();

api.getMobs();                                   // all registered mob definitions (MobInfo)
api.spawn("zombie_brute", player.getLocation()); // Optional<LivingEntity>
api.isBetterMob(entity);                         // is this one of ours?
api.getMobInfo(entity);                          // its definition
api.runSkill("wumpus_wave", player);             // run a skill with any LivingEntity as caster
api.reload();                                    // same as /bettermob reload
```

**Events** (`eu.northsoft.bettermob.api.event`): `BetterMobSpawnEvent` and
`BetterMobDeathEvent`, both exposing the entity and its `MobInfo`.

**Custom mechanics:** register your own mechanic and use it in skill lines like any
built-in one (`heal{amount=4} @self ~onDamaged`). Built-ins can't be overridden, and
your mechanics are removed automatically when your plugin is disabled.

```java
api.registerMechanic(this, "heal", ctx -> {
    double amount = Double.parseDouble(ctx.params().getOrDefault("amount", "2"));
    if (ctx.target() instanceof LivingEntity living) living.heal(amount);
});
```

### Example plugin

[`examples/api-example`](examples/api-example) is a small plugin built on this API: it registers a `heal{amount=4}` mechanic, listens to `BetterMobSpawnEvent` and `BetterMobDeathEvent` and has a `/apiexample <mob>` command that spawns a mob.

```bash
mvn -f examples/api-example/pom.xml package
```

This resolves `com.github.HyperGaming99:bettermob:v1.1.6.2` from JitPack, the same coordinates as above. To compile it against your own checkout instead:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests
mvn -f examples/api-example/pom.xml -Plocal -Dbettermob.version=<version in pom.xml> package
```

The workflow builds it that way on every push and pull request, so it keeps compiling with the API.

## Persistence

Mob state (model tracker, threat table, timers) lives in memory and is tied to the
mob's UUID, tagged via a small PDC marker so it survives a server restart or chunk
unload/reload — `~onLoad` fires again and the model gets reattached automatically.
